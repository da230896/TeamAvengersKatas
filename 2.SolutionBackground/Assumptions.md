## Assumptions

### Call Center 

1. We have assumed call center can create and query ticket status. 
2. We have also assumed that call center operators can access customer data so that it can perform previously stated operations.

### Tickets

We have assumed for now that only one to one tickets would be created in system. Maybe in future we can extend to single ticket for user but multiple tickets in the system. 

This can be used when user wants to register multiple equipments under one ticket instead of multiple tickets.

### Admin

Admin can access the billing of the customer. We have assumed that admin can trigger billing in case of an issue and look into the billing process on customer request.
